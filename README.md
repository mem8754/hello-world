Golf Group Web Application Project
This project is intended to provide utility functions to a golf group, including:
 - local course info (address, contact info, tees, scorecard)
 - player / member info (name, contact info, handicap index)
 - round info (date, scores)
 - schedule (tee times, players, courses)

The app uses AngularJS and Bootstrap for the front-end, and NodeJS / ExpressJS for the web server. Data is stored in a MongoDB database (hosted at MongoLab in a sandbox).
